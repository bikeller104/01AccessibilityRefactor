Tasks to complete for this assignment
	When I view the source code
	Then I find semantic HTML elements
		Semantic HTML elements are tags without associated formatting. 
		I think this means that I need to make sure all formatting that
		describest the html document is in a .css file. 
		Task 1) find all formatting in the HTML tags and move them to a .css file
				replace div tags and other un descriptive tags with main section header footer etc;

	When I view the structure of the HTML elements
	Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
		.css cascades down to the child elements. i want to organize 
		the HTML with spacing and tabs and make sure the HTML follows the
		organization of the displayed webpage
		Task 2) 
	
	When I view the icon and image elements
	Then I find accessible alt atributes
		alt attributes are text that describe images or non-text elements 
		of a webpage
		task 3) add alt attributes to the HTML tags of all non-Text elements
	
	When I view the heading attributes
	Then they fall in sequential order
		task 4) make sure all headings go from h1 - h6 from top to bottom of the document
			and they match the order they show up on the displayed webpage.
	
	When I view the title element
	Then I find a concise, descriptive title
		I think this just wants the title to not be split up between different tags???
		Task 5)
